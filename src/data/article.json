    "content":"Digital mapping refers to the process of creating, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data using computer technology. It involves the use of digital maps, which are representations of geographic information stored and displayed on a computer.MicroBIS (Micro Business Information System) is a term that is not widely recognized, and there is no specific information available on it as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. It is possible that MicroBIS is a specific software or tool developed for microbusinesses, but without more information, it is challenging to provide detailed insights."
